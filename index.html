                    Keyword proximity refers to the distance between your targeted keywords. If the keywords are too close together, they could be interpreted as one broader term. That could lead Google to show your website for searches that it shouldn’t. It’s also possible that your website won’t appear for searches that it should. On the other hand, if the keywords are far apart, it could take Google too long to understand your content. You can find out how close your keywords are to one another with a keyword proximity tool. You can also look at the top search predictions that Google provides when you enter a search term. You can use keyword proximity to identify the right keywords for your site. You can also identify the wrong keywords if your terms are too close together.

                    Before you start targeting keywords, you should find out how many people search for your terms. You can use keyword research tools to find out the search volume for your potential keywords. This will help you figure out which keywords have the most potential. You should also consider the four factors described above to identify the right keywords for your site. If a keyword has a high search volume, but is difficult to rank for, it might not be worth your time. Alternatively, a keyword with a low search volume might be a great fit for your site. You should also take your audience into account when choosing keywords. Don’t just choose a few keywords that have lots of potential. Instead, choose words that your readers will be interested in. You don’t want to be too broad with your topics. Instead, you should choose a few specific terms that will attract the right kind of traffic.
